Step 0: initial setup (ironlauncher)


Step 1: create Book Model + seeds file


Step 2: (READ) display a list with all books in the DB
- [x] Create a route (GET `/books`)
- [x] Make a request to the DB --> Book.find()
- [x] Create a view `books-list.hbs` (and pass the data from the database)


Step 3: (READ) book details page
- [x] Update `books-list.hbs` (add link to each book)
- [x] Create a route (GET `/books/:bookId`)
- [x] Make a request to the DB to get the details of book with id `bookId` --> Book.findById()
- [x] Create view (`book-details.hbs`)



Step 4: (CREATE) functionality to create new books

- Step 4.a: display a form to create new books
  - [x] Create a route (GET `/books/create`)
  - [x] Create a view (`book-create.hbs`)

- Step 4.b: process the form and save new book in DB
  - [x] Create a route (POST `/books/create`)
  - [x] Make a request to the DB to save the new book --> Book.create()
  - [x] After book is created, we will redirect to `/books` (we don't need to create an additional view)



Step 5: (UPDATE) functionality to update a book

- Step 5.a: display a pre-filled form to update a book
  - [x] add link (eg. in book details page)
  - [x] Create a route (GET `/books/:bookId/edit`)
  - [x] Make a request to the DB --> Book.findById()
  - [x] Create a view (`book-edit.hbs`) (and pass the data from the database)

- Step 5.b: process form and update DB

  - [x] Create a route (POST `/books/:bookId/edit`)
  - [x] Query to the DB --> Book.findByIdAndUpdate(id, newBookDetails)
  - [x] Redirect to the book details page


Step 6: (DELETE) functionality to delete a book

- [x] Add a button (ex. in the list of books) -it needs to be inside a form, so that we send a POST request.
- [x] Create a route (POST `/books/:bookId/delete`)
- [x] Query to DB --> Book.findByIdAndDelete(req.params.bookId)
- [x] Redirect to `/books`
